CS355 Compiler Project - Roger Gee and Ethan Rutherford - Fall 2014
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compiling the test module:

To compile the project with its testing module, run 'make' with the 'test' rule:
$ make test

This should generate a single executable that links together the compiler code and
a test module that will perform some operation.

Current operations performed by test module:
    - print out lexical tokens and (if necessary) their source strings
    - print out status of source code parse; this will either indicate that the
source was successfully parsed or print out an error message
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Running the test module:

Pass a file name to the test program on its command-line:
$ ./ramsey-test source.ram
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
